# HetNet-Selection

The codes are relizaitons of our final project of EE357, Computer Network course. 
The topic of our project is "Dynamics of General Network Selection Games in Heterogeneous Networks".
We apply the concept of game theory to this network selection problem.

In our scenerio, there are exactly two games. Evolutionary games are formed in each area, 
i.e. network users located in the same area will reach an evolutionary equilibrium eventually.
Then, user groups in different areas will compete for resources, thus forming a non-cooperative game.
The nash equilibrium point achieved in this non-cooperative game is our target in this problem.

The result of our simulations are shown.
