# HetNet-Selection

The codes are realizations of our final project of EE357, Computer Network course. 
The topic of our project is "Dynamics of General Network Selection Games in Heterogeneous Networks".
We apply the concept of game theory to this network selection problem.

In our scenerio, there are exactly two games. Evolutionary games are formed in each area, 
i.e. network users located in the same area will reach an evolutionary equilibrium eventually. 
Then, users in the same area collaborate with each other (i.e., form a group) to compete for 
the bandwidth with other groups of users in other areas, thus forming a non-cooperative game.
This non-cooperative game formulation is based on the group behavior of the users for network selection, 
while the evolutionary game formulaton is based on the individual behavior of the users.

The nash equilibrium point achieved in the non-cooperative game is our target in this problem. 
The result of our simulations are shown below.
